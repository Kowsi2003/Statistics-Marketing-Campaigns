---

## üìù Project Description

This project analyzes **daily ad campaign data from Facebook and AdWords for 2019** to determine which platform yields better performance in **conversions, clicks, and cost-effectiveness.**

Using **hypothesis testing, regression, cointegration, and EDA**, this project aims to help marketing teams allocate budgets effectively and **maximize ROI**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

‚úÖ Identify which platform (Facebook or AdWords) yields higher conversions.  
‚úÖ Analyze cost-effectiveness trends using **Cost Per Conversion (CPC)**.  
‚úÖ Examine the relationship between clicks and conversions using **correlation and regression**.  
‚úÖ Determine **long-term stability between ad cost and conversions using cointegration analysis**.

## üìà Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Question
> **Which ad platform (Facebook vs. AdWords) is more effective in terms of conversions and cost-efficiency?**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Converted date columns to `datetime` type.
- Removed `%` and `$` symbols from numeric columns.
- Ensured proper numerical type conversion for analysis.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

‚úÖ **Distribution Analysis:** Visualized clicks and conversions using histograms.  
‚úÖ **Conversion Categories:** Classified conversions into:
- `<6`
- `6-10`
- `10-15`
- `>15`

‚úÖ **Insights:**
- Facebook had more frequent higher conversion days.
- AdWords had more days with lower conversion counts.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Analysis

- Facebook: **0.87** (strong positive correlation between clicks and conversions).
- AdWords: **0.45** (moderate positive correlation).

‚úÖ Indicates **clicks strongly predict conversions for Facebook.**

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing (A/B Testing)

#### Hypothesis:
**H‚ÇÄ:** Facebook conversions ‚â§ AdWords conversions  
**H‚ÇÅ:** Facebook conversions > AdWords conversions

**Results:**
- Facebook mean conversions: **11.74**
- AdWords mean conversions: **5.98**
- p-value: `9.35e-134` (very small)

‚úÖ **Reject H‚ÇÄ** ‚Üí Facebook significantly outperforms AdWords in conversions.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Analysis

> **Predicting Facebook conversions based on Facebook ad clicks using Linear Regression.**

- **R¬≤ Score:** 76.35% (good predictive power)
- **Insights:**
  - For 50 clicks ‚Üí expect ~9 conversions
  - For 80 clicks ‚Üí expect ~13.7 conversions

‚úÖ Enables practical planning for ad campaigns based on expected clicks.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Per Conversion (CPC) Trend Analysis

- Tracked monthly CPC trends.
- Found **May and November as lowest CPC months**, making them ideal for higher ad investments.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Cointegration Analysis

Checked for **long-term equilibrium between ad cost and conversions**.

‚úÖ p-value < 0.05 ‚Üí **Confirms a stable relationship**, supporting strategic budget allocation aligned with expected conversions.

---

## üöÄ Key Results

‚úÖ Facebook is **more effective** for conversions and ROI.  
‚úÖ Strong positive correlation between Facebook clicks and conversions.  
‚úÖ Mondays and Tuesdays have higher conversions.  
‚úÖ May and November are cost-effective months for ad spend.
